# GeekOops

Welcome on Geeko-Ops, an awesome collection of SysOps utilities for automated deployment of infrastructure.

This is a project to bring infrastructure templates to the opensource community, especially openSUSE.

Started in the [SUSE Hackweek 20](https://hackweek.suse.com/20/projects/create-ansible-roles-for-generic-server-stuff).
